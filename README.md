- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Charis Michelakis (@chm-von-tla)
- I have a M.Sc. in Finance and Banking and a B.Sc. in Political Science and Public Administration
- I have been interested in Computer Science as a hobby since 2014, till it became a part of my studies (and future career plans) in the context of Applied Econometrics/Statistics and Data Analysis 
- You may want to take a look at the [Julia library/package I wrote for my Master's Thesis](https://github.com/chm-von-tla/ValueAtRisk.jl) or my (admittedly quite minor) [contribution to a related important Econometrics Julia Package](https://github.com/s-broda/ARCHModels.jl/issues/87)
- Most of my hobby projects are hosted in local repos (I don't like posting "spaghetti code" publicly), so you won't find many repos here (I mainly keep here forks of projects I have been playing around with and modified)
